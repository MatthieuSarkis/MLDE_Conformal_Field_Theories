# MLDE_Conformal_Field_Theories

We start a program of classifications of 2-dimensional Fermionic Rational Conformal
Field Theories by making use of the Modular Linear Differential Equation
satisfied by the characters of the RCFT in a given spin structure.

The code is not particularly well commented, but you can ask me any question at matthieu.sarkis@gmail.com
